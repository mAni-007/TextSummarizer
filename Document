reveals himself to be the keeper of keys and grounds at hogwarts as well as some of harry s history harry learns that as a baby he witnessed his parents murder by the power obsessed dark wizard lord voldemort who subsequently attempted to kill him as well instead the unexpected happened harry survived with only a lightning shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack and voldemort disappeared soon afterwards gravely weakened by his own rebounding curse as its inadvertent saviour from voldemort s reign of terror harry has become a living legend in the wizarding world however at the orders of the venerable and well known wizard albus dumbledore the orphaned harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant muggle relatives the dursleys who have kept him safe but treated him

school of mudbloods a derogatory term describing wizards and witches of non magical parentage the memory of tom riddle resides inside of the diary and when ginny begins to confide in the diary voldemort is able to possess her through the diary ginny acts on voldemort s orders and unconsciously opens the chamber of secrets unleashing an ancient monster later revealed to be a basilisk which

thorne based on a story by j k rowling thorne and director john tiffany the play opened on july at the palace theatre london england the script was released on july the story is set nineteen years after the ending of harry potter and the deathly hallows and follows harry potter now a ministry of magic employee and his younger son albus severus potter the play s official synopsis was released on october it was always difficult being harry potter and it isn t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the ministry of magic a husband and father of three school age children while harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs his youngest son albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted as past and present fuse ominously both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth sometimes darkness comes from unexpected places rowling expanded the harry potter universe with several short books produced for various charities in she released fantastic beasts and where to find them a purported hogwarts textbook and quidditch through the ages a book harry reads for fun proceeds from the sale of these two books benefited the charity comic relief in rowling composed seven handwritten copies of the tales of beedle the bard a collection of fairy tales that is featured in the final novel one of which was auctioned to raise money for the children s high level group a fund for mentally disabled children in poor countries the book was published internationally on december rowling also wrote an word prequel in as part of a fundraiser organised by the bookseller waterstones all three of these books contain extra information about the wizarding world not included in the original novels in she released three new e books hogwarts an incomplete and unreliable guide short stories from hogwarts of power politics and pesky poltergeists and short stories from hogwarts of heroism hardship and dangerous hobbies in rowling launched a new website announcing an upcoming project called pottermore pottermore opened to the general public on april pottermore allows users to be sorted be chosen by their wand and play various minigames the main purpose of the website was to allow the user to journey through the story with access to content not revealed by jk rowling previously with over words of additional content in september the website was completely overhauled and most of the features were removed the site has been redesigned and it mainly focuses on the information already available rather than exploration the harry potter novels are mainly directed at a young adult audience as opposed to an audience of middle grade readers children or adults the novels fall within the genre of fantasy literature and qualify as a type of fantasy called urban fantasy contemporary fantasy or low fantasy they are mainly dramas and maintain a fairly serious and dark tone throughout though they do contain some notable instances of tragicomedy and black humour in many respects they are also examples of the bildungsroman or coming of age novel and contain elements of mystery adventure horror thriller and romance the books are also in the words of stephen king shrewd mystery tales and each book is constructed in the manner of a sherlock holmes style mystery adventure the stories are told from a third person limited point of view with very few exceptions such as the opening chapters of philosopher s stone goblet of fire and deathly hallows and the first two chapters of half blood prince the series can be considered part of the british children s boarding school genre which includes rudyard kipling s stalky co enid blyton s malory towers st clare s and the naughtiest girl series and frank richards s billy bunter novels the harry potter books are predominantly set in hogwarts a fictional british boarding school for wizards where the curriculum includes the use of magic in this sense they are in a direct line of descent from thomas hughes s tom brown s school days and other victorian and edwardian novels of british public school life though they are as many note more contemporary grittier darker and more mature than the typical boarding school novel addressing serious themes of death love loss prejudice coming of age and the loss of innocence in a s british setting the harry potter stories feature medieval imagery and motifs drawn from the king arthur stories hogwarts resembles a medieval university cum castle with several professors who belonging to an order of merlin old professor binns still lectures about the international warlock convention of and a real historical person a th century scribe sir nicolas flamel is described as a holder of the philosopher s stone other medieval elements in hogwarts include coats of arms and medieval weapons on the walls letters written on parchment and sealed with wax the great hall of hogwarts which is similar to the great hall of camelot the use of latin phrases the tents put up for quidditch tournaments are similar to the marvellous tents put up for knightly tournaments imaginary animals like dragons and unicorns which exist around hogwarts and the banners with heraldic animals for the four houses of hogwarts many of the motifs of the potter stories such as the hero s quest invoking objects that confer invisibility magical animals and trees a forest full of danger and the recognition of a character based upon scars are drawn from medieval french arthurian romances other aspects borrowed from french arthurian romances include the use of owls as messengers werewolves as characters and white deer the american scholars heather arden and kathrn lorenz in particular argue that many aspects of the potter stories are inspired by a th century french arthurian romance claris et laris writing of the startling similarities between the adventures of potter and the knight claris arden and lorenz noted that rowling graduated from the university of exeter in with a degree in french literature and spent a year living in france afterwards arnden and lorenz wrote about the similarity between the arthurian romances where camelot is a place of wonder and safety and from where the heroic knights must venture forth facing various perils usually in an enchanted forest and hogwarts likewise a wondrous safe place where harry potter and friends must periodically venture forth from to the magical forest that surrounds hogwarts in the same way that knights in the arthurian romances usually have a female helper who is very intelligent and has a connection with nature harry has hermione who plays a similar role like an arthurian knight harry receives advice and encouragement from his mentor albus dumbledore who resembles both merlin and king arthur but must vanquish his foes alone arnden and lorenz wrote that with rowling s books the characters are not a simple reworking of the well known heroes of romance but a protean melding of different characters to form new ones however lorenz and arnden argue the main inspiration for harry potter was sir percival one of the knights of the round table who searches for the holy grail both potter and sir percival had an orphaned or semi orphaned youth with inherent nobility and powers being raised by relatives who tried to keep them away from the places where they really belong hogwarts and camelot respectively both percival and potter are however outsiders in the places that they belong unfamiliar with the rules of knighthood and magic but both show extraordinary natural abilities with percival proving himself an exceptional fighter while potter is an excellent player of quidditch and finally both percival and potter found love and acceptance from surrogate families in the form of the knights of the round table and the weasley family respectively each of the seven books is set over the course of one school year harry struggles with the problems he encounters and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules if students are caught breaking rules they are often disciplined by hogwarts professors the stories reach their climax in the summer term near or just after final exams when events escalate far beyond in school squabbles and struggles and harry must confront either voldemort or one of his followers the death eaters with the stakes a matter of life and death a point underlined as the series progresses by characters being killed in each of the final four books in the aftermath he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and mentor albus dumbledore the only exception to this school centred setting is the final novel harry potter and the deathly hallows in which harry and his friends spend most of their time away from hogwarts and only return there to face voldemort at the d nouement according to rowling a major theme in the series is death my books are largely about death they open with the death of harry s parents there is voldemort s obsession with conquering death and his quest for immortality at any price the goal of anyone with magic i so understand why voldemort wants to conquer death we re all frightened of it rowling stated that harry potter books have always in fact dealt explicitly with religious themes and questions and that she did not reveal its christian parallels in the beginning because doing so would have give n too much away to fans who might then see the parallels in the final book of the series harry potter and the deathly hallows rowling makes the book s christian imagery more explicit quoting both matthew and corinthians king james version when harry visits his parents graves hermione granger teaches harry potter that the meaning of these verses from the christian bible are living beyond death living after death which rowling states is one of the central foundations of resurrection theology and that these bible verses epitomize the whole series rowling also exhibits christian values in developing albus dumbledore as a god like character the divine trusted leader of the series guiding the long suffering hero along his quest in the seventh novel harry speaks with and questions the deceased dumbledore much like a person of faith would talk to and question god academics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes in the books some more complex than others and some including political subtexts themes such as normality oppression survival and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series similarly the theme of making one s way through adolescence and going over one s most harrowing ordeals and thus coming to terms with them has also been considered rowling has stated that the books comprise a prolonged argument for tolerance a prolonged plea for an end to bigotry and that they also pass on a message to question authority and not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth while the books could be said to comprise many other themes such as power abuse of power violence and hatred love loss prejudice and free choice they are as rowling states deeply entrenched in the whole plot the writer prefers to let themes grow organically rather than sitting down and consciously attempting to impart such ideas to her readers along the same lines is the ever present theme of adolescence in whose depiction rowling has been purposeful in acknowledging her characters sexualities and not leaving harry as she put it stuck in a state of permanent pre pubescence rowling has also been praised for her nuanced depiction of the ways in which death and violence affects youth and humanity as a whole rowling said that to her the moral significance of the tales seems blindingly obvious the key for her was the choice between what is right and what is easy because that is how tyranny is started with people being apathetic and taking the easy route and suddenly finding themselves in deep trouble in rowling was on a crowded train from manchester to london when the idea for harry suddenly fell into her head rowling gives an account of the experience on her website saying i had been writing almost continuously since the age of six but i had never been so excited about an idea before i simply sat and thought for four delayed train hours and all the details bubbled up in my brain and this scrawny black haired bespectacled boy who did not know he was a wizard became more and more real to me rowling completed harry potter and the philosopher s stone in and the manuscript was sent off to several prospective agents the second agent she tried christopher little offered to represent her and sent the manuscript to bloomsbury after eight other publishers had rejected philosopher s stone bloomsbury offered rowling a advance for its publication despite rowling s statement that she did not have any particular age group in mind when beginning to write the harry potter books the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven on the eve of publishing rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more gender neutral pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group fearing that they would not be interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman she elected to use j k rowling joanne kathleen rowling using her grandmother s name as her second name because she has no middle name harry potter and the philosopher s stone was published by bloomsbury the publisher of all harry potter books in the united kingdom on june it was released in the united states on september by scholastic the american publisher of the books as harry potter and the sorcerer s stone after rowling had received us for the american rights a record amount for a children s book by an unknown author fearing that american readers would not associate the word philosopher with magic although the philosopher s stone is an ancient tradition in alchemy scholastic insisted that the book be given the title harry potter and the sorcerer s stone for the american market the second book harry potter and the chamber of secrets was originally published in the uk on july and in the us on june harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban was published a year later in the uk on july and in the us

to work on the books were well known authors before their work on harry potter such as viktor golyshev who oversaw the russian translation of the series fifth book the turkish translation of books two to seven was undertaken by sevin okyay a popular literary critic and cultural commentator for reasons of secrecy translation on a given book could only start after it had been released in english leading to a lag of several months before the translations were available this led to more and more copies of the english editions being sold to impatient fans in non english speaking countries for example such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its english language edition became the first english language book ever to top the best seller list in france the united states editions were adapted into american english to make them more understandable to a young american audience in december rowling stated on her web site will be the year when i write the final book in the harry potter series updates then followed in her online diary chronicling the progress of harry potter and the deathly hallows with the release date of july the book itself was finished on january in the balmoral hotel edinburgh where she scrawled a message on the back of a bust of hermes it read j k rowling finished writing harry potter and the deathly hallows in this room on january rowling herself has stated that the last chapter of the final book in fact the epilogue was completed in something like in june rowling on an appearance on the british talk show richard judy announced that the chapter had been modified as one character got a reprieve and two others who previously survived the story had in fact been killed on march the cover art for the bloomsbury adult and child versions and the scholastic version were released in september rowling mentioned in an interview that she might go back to make a director s cut of two of the existing harry potter books for cover art bloomsbury chose painted art in a classic style of design with the first cover a watercolour and pencil drawing by illustrator thomas taylor showing harry boarding the hogwarts express and a title in the font cochin bold the first releases of the successive books in the series followed in the same style but somewhat more realistic illustrating scenes from the books these covers were created by first cliff wright and then jason cockroft due to the appeal of the books among an adult audience bloomsbury commissioned a second line of editions in an adult style these initially used black and white photographic art for the covers showing objects from the books including a very american hogwarts express without depicting people but later shifted to partial colourisation with a picture of slytherin s locket on the cover of the final book international and later editions have been created by a range of designers including mary grandpr for u s audiences and mika launis in finland for a later american release kazu kibuishi created covers in a somewhat anime influenced style fans of the series were so eager for the latest instalment that bookstores around the world began holding events to coincide with the midnight release of the books beginning with the publication of harry potter and the goblet of fire the events commonly featuring mock sorting games face painting and other live entertainment have

cultural icons in november the bbc listed the harry potter series on its list of the most influential novels early in its history harry potter received positive reviews on publication the first book harry potter and the philosopher s stone attracted attention from the scottish newspapers such as the scotsman which said it had all the makings of a classic and the glasgow herald which called it magic stuff soon the english newspapers joined in with more than one comparing it to roald dahl s work the mail on sunday rated it as the most imaginative debut since roald dahl a view echoed by the sunday times comparisons to dahl are this time justified while the guardian called it a richly textured novel given lift off by an inventive wit by the time of the release of the fifth book harry potter and the order of the phoenix the books began to receive strong criticism from a number of literary scholars yale professor literary scholar and critic harold bloom raised criticisms of the books literary merits saying rowling s mind is so governed by clich s and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing a s byatt authored an op ed article in the new york times calling rowling s universe a secondary secondary world made up of intelligently patchworked derivative motifs from all sorts of children s literature written for people whose imaginative lives are confined to tv cartoons and the exaggerated more exciting not threatening mirror worlds of soaps reality tv and celebrity gossip michael rosen a novelist and poet advocated the books were not suited for children as they would be unable to grasp the complex themes rosen also stated that j k rowling is more of an adult writer the critic anthony holden wrote in the observer on his experience of judging harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban for the whitbread awards his overall view of the series was negative the potter saga was essentially patronising conservative highly derivative dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone britain and he speaks of a pedestrian ungrammatical prose style ursula k le guin said i have no great opinion of it when so many adult critics were carrying on about the incredible originality of the first harry potter book i read it to find out what the fuss was about and remained somewhat puzzled it seemed a lively kid s fantasy crossed with a school novel good fare for its age group but stylistically ordinary imaginatively derivative and ethically rather mean spirited by contrast author fay weldon while admitting that the series is not what the poets hoped for nevertheless goes on to say but this is not poetry it is readable saleable everyday useful prose the literary critic a n wilson praised the harry potter series in the times stating there are not many writers who have jk s dickensian ability to make us turn the pages to weep openly with tears splashing and a few pages later to laugh at invariably good jokes we have lived through a decade in which we have followed the publication of the liveliest funniest scariest and most moving children s stories ever written charles taylor of salon com who is primarily a movie critic took issue with byatt s criticisms in particular while he conceded that she may have a valid cultural point a teeny one about the impulses that drive us to reassuring pop trash and away from the troubling complexities of art he rejected her claims that the series is lacking in serious literary merit and that it owes its success merely to the childhood reassurances it offers taylor stressed the progressively darker tone of the books shown by the murder of a classmate and close friend and the psychological wounds and social isolation each causes taylor also argued that philosopher s stone said to be the most light hearted of the seven published books disrupts the childhood reassurances that byatt claims spur the series success the book opens with news of a double murder for example stephen king called the series a feat of which only a superior imagination is capable and declared rowling s punning one eyebrow cocked sense of humor to be remarkable however he wrote that despite the story being a good one he is a little tired of discovering harry at home with his horrible aunt and uncle the formulaic beginning of all seven books king has also joked that rowling s never met an adverb she did not like he does however predict that harry potter will indeed stand time s test and wind up on a shelf where only the best are kept i think harry will take his place with alice huck frodo and dorothy and this is one series not just for the decade but for the ages sameer rahim of the daily telegraph disagreed saying it depresses me to see and year olds reading the series when they could be reading the great novels of childhood such as oliver twist or a house for mr biswas what that says about the adults who are fanatical fans i m not sure but i suspect in years to come people will make a link between our plump comfortable infantilising society and the popularity of potter there is ongoing discussion regarding the extent to which the series was inspired by tolkien s lord of the rings books although time magazine named rowling as a runner up for its person of the year award noting the social moral and political inspiration she has given her fandom cultural comments on the series have been mixed washington post book critic ron charles opined in july that the large numbers of adults reading the potter series but few other books may represent a bad case of cultural infantilism and that the straightforward good vs evil theme of the series is childish he also argued through no fault of rowling s the cultural and marketing hysteria marked by the publication of the later books trains children and adults to expect the roar of the coliseum a mass media experience that no other novel can possibly provide librarian nancy knapp pointed out the books potential to improve literacy by motivating children to read much more than they otherwise would the seven book series has a word count of us edition agreeing about the motivating effects diane penrod also praised the books blending of simple entertainment with the qualities of highbrow literary fiction but expressed concern about the distracting effect of the prolific merchandising that accompanies the book launches however the assumption that harry potter books have increased literacy among young people is largely a folk legend research by the national endowment for the arts nea has found no increase in reading among children coinciding with the harry potter publishing phenomenon nor has the broader downward trend in reading among americans been arrested during the rise in the popularity of the harry potter books the research also found that children who read harry potter books were not more likely to go on to read outside the fantasy and mystery genres nea chairman dana gioia said the series got millions of kids to read a long and reasonably complex series of books the trouble is that one harry potter novel every few years is not enough to reverse the decline in reading jennifer conn used snape s and quidditch coach madam hooch s teaching methods as examples of what to avoid and what to emulate in clinical teaching and joyce fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first year sociology class sociological concepts including culture society and socialisation stratification and social inequality social institutions and social theory from the early s onwards several news reports appeared in the uk of the harry potter book and movie series driving demand for pet owls and even reports that after the end of the movie series these same pet owls were now being abandoned by their owners this led j k rowling to issue several statements urging harry potter fans to refrain from purchasing pet owls despite the media flurry research into the popularity of harry potter and sales of owls in the uk failed to find any evidence that the harry potter franchise had influenced the buying of owls in the country or the number of owls reaching animal shelters and sanctuaries jenny sawyer wrote in christian science monitor on july that the books represent a disturbing trend in commercial storytelling and western society in that stories moral center sic have all but vanished from much of today s pop culture after years pages and over million copies j k rowling s towering achievement lacks the cornerstone of almost all great children s literature the hero s moral journey harry potter sawyer argues neither faces a moral struggle nor undergoes any ethical growth and is thus no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than black and white in contrast emily griesinger described harry s first passage through to platform as an application of faith and hope and his encounter with the sorting hat as the first of many in which harry is shaped by the choices he makes she also noted the deeper magic by which the self sacrifice of harry s mother protects the boy throughout the series and which the power hungry voldemort fails to understand in an november slate article chris suellentrop likened potter to a trust fund kid whose success at school is largely attributable to the gifts his friends and relatives lavish upon him noting that in rowling s fiction magical ability potential is something you are born to not something you can achieve suellentrop wrote that dumbledore s maxim that it is our choices that show what we truly are far more than our abilities is hypocritical as the school that dumbledore runs values native gifts above all else in a august review of deathly hallows in the new york times however christopher hitchens praised rowling for unmooring her english school story from literary precedents bound up with dreams of wealth and class and snobbery arguing that she had instead created a world of youthful democracy and diversity in coinciding with the release of the film harry potter and the deathly hallows part a series of articles were written about private harry potter of the british army this real life harry potter was killed in the arab revolt near hebron in his grave located in the british cemetery in ramla israel began to receive curious visitors leading the ramla municipality to list it on their website in an article written by diana c mutz compares the politics of harry potter to the donald trump presidential campaign she states that themes throughout the books are widely predominant the value of tolerance and respect for difference opposition to violence and punitiveness and the dangers of authoritarianism she suggests that these themes are also present in the presidential election and it may play a significant role in how americans have responded to the campaign the books have been the subject of a number of legal proceedings stemming from various conflicts over copyright and trademark infringements the popularity and high market value of the series has led rowling her publishers and film distributor warner bros to take legal measures to protect their copyright which have included banning the sale of harry potter imitations targeting the owners of websites over the harry potter domain name and suing author nancy stouffer to counter her accusations that rowling had plagiarised her work various religious fundamentalists have claimed that the books promote witchcraft and religions such as wicca and are therefore unsuitable for children while a number of critics have criticised the books for promoting various political agendas the books also aroused controversies in the literary and publishing worlds from to harry potter and the philosopher s stone won almost all the uk awards judged by children but none of the children s book awards judged by adults and sandra beckett suggested the reason was intellectual snobbery towards books that were popular among children in the winner of the whitbread book of the year award children s division was entered for the first time on the shortlist for the main award and one judge threatened to resign if harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban was declared the overall winner it finished second very close behind the winner of the poetry prize seamus heaney s translation of the anglo saxon epic beowulf in shortly before the publication of harry potter and the goblet of fire the previous three harry potter books topped the new york times fiction best seller list and a third of the entries were children s books the newspaper created a new children s section covering children s books including both fiction and non fiction and initially counting only hardback sales the move was supported by publishers and booksellers in the new york times further split the children s list which was still dominated by harry potter books into sections for series and individual books and removed the harry potter books from the section for individual books the split in attracted condemnation praise and some comments that presented both benefits and disadvantages of the move time suggested that on the same principle billboard should have created a separate mop tops list in when the beatles held the top five places in its list and nielsen should have created a separate game show list when who wants to be a millionaire dominated the ratings in rowling sold the film rights of the first four harry potter books to warner bros for a reported million rowling demanded the principal cast be kept strictly british nonetheless allowing for the inclusion of irish actors such as the late richard harris as dumbledore and for casting of french and eastern european actors in harry potter and the goblet of fire where characters from the book are specified as such after many directors including steven spielberg terry gilliam jonathan demme and alan parker were considered chris columbus was appointed on march as the director for harry potter and the philosopher s stone titled harry potter and the sorcerer s stone in the united states with warner bros citing his work on other family films such as home alone and mrs doubtfire and proven experience with directing children as influences for their decision after extensive casting filming began in october at leavesden film studios and in london itself with production ending in july philosopher s stone was released on november just three days after the film s release production for harry potter and the chamber of secrets also directed by columbus began filming was completed in summer with the film being released on november daniel radcliffe portrayed harry potter doing so for all succeeding films in the

while prisoner of azkaban grossed the least as well as being a financial success the film series has also been a success among film critics opinions of the films are generally divided among fans with one group preferring the more faithful approach of the first two films and another group preferring the more stylised character driven approach of the later films rowling has been constantly supportive of all the films and evaluated deathly hallows as her favourite one in the series she wrote on her website of the changes in the book to film transition it is simply impossible to incorporate every one of my storylines into a film that has to be kept under four hours long obviously films have restrictions novels do not have constraints of time and budget i can create dazzling effects relying on nothing but the interaction of my own and my readers imaginations at the th british academy film awards in february rowling was joined by producers david heyman and david barron
